<hr />

<p>This is one of the most beautiful and showy of the South Africa species
of <i>Aloe</i>. Specimens were collected by Messrs. Wickens and Pienaar in
M‘Phathlele’s Location in the Northern Transvaal, in January, 1914. The
species is also found widely distributed in the Oliphants River
Bushveld. It is now established in the Garden of the Division of Botany,
Pretoria, and in the latter part of July and August when in flower is a
source of great admiration to visitors.</p>

<p>In general appearance and habit of growth this <i>Aloe</i> closely resembles
<i>A. Pienaarii</i> from the same locality, figured in vol. i. of this work
(Plate 27), but it is more commonly found on gentle slopes in bush
country, although it may frequently occur in open ground along with <i>A.
Pienaarii</i>. When the plants are not in flower, those of <i>A. Wickensii</i>
can be distinguished from <i>A. Pienaarii</i> by their paler green leaves,
which are distinctly incurved.</p>

<p>We propose the name “Wickens’ Aloe” for this species.</p>

<p>Specimens are preserved in the National Herbarium, Pretoria (Herb. No.
1449).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Description</span>:&mdash;A stemless succulent herb. <i>Leaves</i> pale glaucous-green,
40-50 in a dense rosette, 50-70 cm. long, 10-13 cm. broad at the base,
lanceolate-ensiform, erect, distinctly incurved, rather flat above,
convex beneath, beset on the margins with small deltoid black prickles
about 2 mm. long and about 6-8 mm. apart. <i>Inflorescences</i> often 2-4

<hr />

<p>A common species in certain habitats in South Africa, and extending to
Tropical Africa, throughout India to Japan, and the Moluccas. On account
of its easy cultivation and the exquisite deep shade of blue of the
petals, it deserves more recognition from gardeners, and should be at
least as great a favourite as species of <i>Tradescantia</i> (The Wandering
Jew). The floral structure shows interesting modifications in the
stamens, and a study of the method of pollination would certainly bring
to light some interesting facts. This plant often produces at the base
modified (cleistogamic) flowers which burrow into the ground and produce
small capsules.</p>

<p>The original drawing from which our figure has been reproduced was
prepared by Miss Page and loaned by the Curator of the Bolus Herbarium.
The plants flowered in March and April at the National Botanic Gardens,
Kirstenbosch (No. 1232/18), and were sent by Mr. G. Hay from Louis
Trichardt, Transvaal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Description</span>:&mdash;A diffuse herbaceous plant. <i>Stem</i> 15-80 cm. long.
<i>Leaves</i> 3-8 cm. long, 1·5-3·5 cm. broad, ovate or elliptic-ovate,
acute, contracted at the base into a sheath often ciliate with reddish
hairs, and usually wavy margins. <i>Flowers</i> partly enclosed in a green
hairy spathe, the topmost flower long-exserted. <i>Sepals</i> 3; the two side
sepals more or less orbicular; the odd sepal elliptic. <i>Petals</i> 3; the
two side petals dark blue, semi-orbicular, produced at the base into a
distinct claw; the odd petal small, ovate-elliptic. <i>Stamens</i> 6, divided

<hr />

<p>This is a very rare species here figured for the first time. It was
discovered by Carl Zeyher at Hardeveld in little Namaqualand about the
year 1847, and appears to have been unrecorded since then until recently
collected by Mr. E. B. Watermeyer. The genus <i>Hessea</i> is endemic to
South Africa, and contains nine species found in the Cape Province,
Little Namaqualand, and one species from the Transvaal. Hitherto none
has been recorded from Natal or the Orange Free State. Our specimen
differs slightly from the original described in the “Flora Capensis” in
having three rather shorter leaves contemporary with the flowers. At
first the style is short, but elongates as the flowers mature.</p>

<p>Our illustration was prepared from a drawing by Miss M. Page of
specimens which flowered in April at the National Botanic Gardens,
Kirstenbosch (No. 1157/16), and collected by Mr. E. B. Watermeyer,
Nieuwoudtville, Calvinia Division. The drawing has been kindly loaned by
the Curator of the Bolus Herbarium.</p>

narrowing and channelled at the base. <i>Peduncle</i> arising at the side of

<p>In our last number (Plate 39) we figured a species of <i>Ceropegia
Rendallii</i>, which belongs to a group of the genus characterised by
having the corolla-lobes united into an umbrella-like canopy supported
by five short stalks. The present species has the corolla-lobes free at
the base, then connate into a slender column, again becoming free and
then connate at the tips, forming a small terminal cage-like body.</p>

<p>It shares this character with <i>Ceropegia Haygarthii</i>, Schlechter, and in
this respect the two species are unique amongst the South African
species. In <i>C. Haygarthii</i>, however, the corolla is very widely globose
at the base, the calyx lobes are longer, and the peculiar stalk to the
corolla lobes is at least three or four times as long. These differences
seem to warrant the description of a new species. The curiously shaped
flowers should make this species an object of interest in the
greenhouse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_22" id="page_22">{22}</a></span></p>

<hr />

<p>We have pleasure in figuring in this number, through the kindness of the
Curator of the Bolus Herbarium, our first species of one of the most
popular of South African genera, namely, <i>Watsonia</i>. Species of this
genus have long been known in European Gardens, where they were
introduced by the early botanical collectors from the Cape. The genus is
represented in South Africa by about twenty species, and with the
exception of a species which occurs in Madagascar, are confined to the
sub-continent. The Watsonias lend themselves to hybridising, and some
very fine garden hybrids have been produced.</p>

<p>The species here figured was first discovered by Mr. E. E. Galpin at
Lottering Bush, Zitzikama (<i>Galpin</i> No. 4698), and re-collected at
Knysna by Miss A. V. Duthie, who sent corms to the National Botanic
Gardens, where they flowered in March, 1919 (No. 239/18).</p>

<p>The general name of “pijpie” is applied to almost all species of
<i>Watsonia</i> and also to some species of <i>Gladiolus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Description</span>:&mdash;<i>Corm</i> 2 cm. in diameter, depressed-globose, oblique at
the base. <i>Stem</i> 75 cm. long, racemose. <i>Leaves</i> 4-8, radical, up to 35
cm. long, 1-1·5 cm. broad, linear, acute, acuminate, with the median and
marginal nerves somewhat subprominent. <i>Inflorescence</i> simple or
branched. <i>Spathe-valves</i> herbaceous or submembranous at the apex; the
outer 0·6-3·2 cm. long, lanceolate, setaceous acuminate; the inner
0·8-1·4 cm. long, ovate or broadly ovate, acuminate. <i>Perianth-tube</i> 2
cm. long, constricted about the middle; the lower half filiform,
scarcely 1·5 mm. in diameter; the upper half infundibuliform, 7 mm. in
diameter near the throat; lobes spreading,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_26" id="page_26">{26}</a></span> 1·5 cm. long; the outer up
to 8 mm. broad, suboblong, subacute, minutely apiculate; the inner 1 cm.
broad, oblong-obovate. <i>Stamens</i> almost as long as the perianth lobes;
anthers 9 mm. long. <i>Ovary</i> about 5 mm. long, subobconic; style 2·9 cm.
long; primary branches 9 mm. long; stigmas about 2 mm. long. <i>Fruit</i> 1
cm. long, obconic.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bolus remarks, “Distinguished from the rest of the section
‘Eu-Watsonia’ by the more slender habit, the smaller spathe-valves, the
shorter perianth-tube and relatively long segments.”</p>

<hr />

<p>All the species of <i>Massonia</i>, an endemic Cape genus of the <i>Liliaceae</i>,
have fragrant hyacinthoid flowers, arising in a sessile cluster from
between two broad prostrate leaves. The name was given to the genus by
Carl Thunberg to commemorate the name of Francis Masson, who was sent to
the Cape in 1772 as collector for the Royal Gardens at Kew, and who was
responsible for introducing a large number of Cape plants into
cultivation. The first 20 volumes of Curtis’s <i>Botanical Magazine</i>,
which contain 786 plates, have nearly one-third devoted to figures of
Cape species, mostly sent to Kew Gardens by Masson.</p>

<p>The genus <i>Massonia</i> is very imperfectly known, as about 24 out of the
33 species described in the “Flora Capensis” have never been collected
within the last 50 years, or are only known from figures in botanical
publications. It is, therefore, with some pleasure that we publish our
first plate representing a species of the genus, collected by Mrs. E.
Rood, of Van Rhynsdorp, in the hope that it may stimulate others to
forward specimens to the Division of Botany, Pretoria, for illustration
in future numbers of this work.</p>

<p>This particular species was figured by Jacquin in 1803. Specimens are
preserved in the National Herbarium, Pretoria (Herb. No. 1450).</p>

<p>We may perhaps be excused for figuring this species, which has appeared
as a plate more than once in Curtis’s <i>Botanical Magazine</i>. It is,
however, still such a favourite with cultivators that it is deemed
worthy of a figure in a South African publication. Like other of our
native plants it was known in European gardens many years ago, and is
recorded as having flowered at Kew Gardens in 1707. As a cultivated
plant it was known under the name of <i>Tritoma Uvaria</i>, which was later
changed to <i>Kniphofia Uvaria</i>. It was also described by Linnaeus about
the year 1735 as an <i>Aloe</i>. Specimens of the plant in cultivation may be
seen in many South African gardens. It is the most robust and most
variable species of the genus. In the coastal districts of Natal two
varieties, <i>nobilis</i> and <i>maxima</i>, are found, but our figure and
description apply to the typical form. The common name is the “Red-hot
poker.” The natives of Natal know the plant as “i-Cacane.”</p>

<p>The plate was drawn from a specimen collected near Durban in July, 1914.</p>

<p>Harvey first described and figured this remarkable species of
<i>Heliophila</i> in 1863, from specimens which he received from Mr. M‘Ken.
The late Dr. Medley Wood sent a plant of it to Kew in 1885, which
flowered in the succulent house the following year, and has continued to
do so about mid-winter ever since. From the plant which flowered at Kew
a plate was prepared for the <i>Botanical Magazine</i>, t. 7668.</p>

<p>According to the Kew authorities, in the whole of the large Natural
Order <i>Cruciferae</i>, embracing about 180 genera, only two are recorded as
having scandent species. They are the South African <i>Heliophila</i> and the
Peruvian <i>Cremolobus</i>, and the scandent habit is exceptional in these
two genera.</p>

<p>The plant may be found in shady places amongst shrubs along the coast
near Durban and also at Inanda. The present plate was prepared from
specimens gathered near Durban in July, 1914. The species is popularly
known as the “Bridal Wreath.”</p>

<p>This beautiful and showy plant was first collected by Dr. I. B. Pole
Evans at Komati Poort in November, 1917, and specimens sent to Kew were
reported to be an undescribed species of the genus. Sir Wm. Hoy, the
General Manager of the South African Railways, presented two living
specimens to the Division of Botany, Pretoria, and our plate was
prepared from these plants when they flowered.</p>

<p>The plant is a large bush 10-20 ft. high, and when in full bloom is one
of the most conspicuous objects in the veld. The calyx in this species
very soon becomes almost fully developed, and the young corolla is at
first only visible as a minute ball at the base of the saucer-shaped
calyx.</p>

<p><i>Holmskioldia</i> is a small genus with a curious distribution. A handsome
species, <i>H. sanguinea</i>, Retz, occurs in the foothills of the Himalaya
mountains of India at an altitude of 3000-5000 ft. <i>H. tettensis</i>, <i>H.
spinescens</i>, and <i>H. mucronata</i>, Vatke, are found in the basin of the
Lower Zambesi and Shire Rivers, and there is an unnamed species in
Madagascar. The genus is very closely related to <i>Clerodendron</i>, largely
represented in all these areas.</p>

<hr />

<p>The native species of <i>Gazania</i> receive perhaps more attention from
gardeners than other groups of South African <i>Compositae</i>. This is due
to their easy cultivation and the brightness of their “flowers.” The
general names “Gousblom” and “Marigolds” are applied indiscriminately to
various species of <i>Gazania</i>, <i>Arctotis</i> and <i>Dimorphotheca</i>.</p>

<p>Our plate was prepared from plants flowering at the Division of Botany,
Pretoria. The plant is acquiescent and forms a compact clump about 2
feet in diameter. It flowers freely and is easily propagated. We hope in
future numbers to illustrate all the better known kinds of “Gousblom,”
especially some of the beautiful Namaqualand species.</p>

<p>Our specimen bears out Harvey’s statement that this species and <i>G.
longiscapa</i> are scarcely distinct, as it agrees with <i>G. subulata</i> in
having the peduncle pilose and with <i>G. longiscapa</i> in the
cartilaginous-ciliate leaves which are glabrous on the mid-rib below.</p>

<hr />

<p>This species of <i>Pelargonium</i> is one of the many botanical curiosities
found in the arid regions of South-West Africa, where the native plants
have to contend against very adverse conditions. In the dry season the
plant loses its leaves and assumes a knobby appearance due to the thick
rather woody stems. The leaves appear after the rains and are more or
less crowded at the ends of the branches.</p>

<p>The species was first discovered by Mr. Ant. Hove in 1786 in South-West
Africa, and was introduced by him into Kew Gardens the same year. In
1799 a figure was published in the <i>Botanical Magazine</i> (t. 477)
prepared from a plant which flowered with Messrs. Grimwood &amp; Co.,
Kensington, London. Though this figure does not quite agree with our
specimen in the markings of the petals, we have no doubt that it
represents the plant here illustrated, which can only be considered as a
variety.</p>

<p>Our plant was collected by Dr. I. B. Pole Evans, C.M.G., who states that
it is common on rocky outcrops in the Nabib Desert at Luderitzbuch. It
has been established and flowered at the Gardens of the Division of
Botany, Pretoria. Specimens are preserved in the National Herbarium,
Pretoria (Herb. No. 1452).</p>

<p>This is the well-known “Coral Aloe” of South Africa. It is typical of
both the Upper and Lower Karroo regions and also of the Namaqualand
region. The species is generally found on dry rocky slopes, and the
plants assume a subdecumbent position, very rarely growing erect. It is
the only South African species of <i>Aloe</i> which bears leaves without
prickly teeth. In the dry summer season the leaves lose their
bluish-grey colour and become a copper-red, which gives the plants a
very characteristic appearance in the veld. A large number of hybrids
have been raised by crossing this species with others belonging to the
<i>Saponaria</i> group, and a hybrid, described as <i>Aloe Lynchii</i>, was
obtained between this and <i>Gasteria verrucosa</i>.</p>

<p>The late Prof. MacOwan states that sun-birds (<i>Nectarineae</i>) are the
pollinating agents of <i>Aloe striata</i> and some other species of <i>Aloe</i>,
and if the birds are kept away by covering the inflorescence with wire
netting, few or no capsules are produced.</p>

Harvey, who examined specimens of this plant collected by Burke and
Zeyher on the Aapies River and Magaliesberg, also included it under <i>D.
Ecklonis</i>. Dr. Schlechter first recognised that the Transvaal plant was
an undescribed species, but apparently did not realise that Burke and
Zeyher had collected the plant close on a hundred years ago, as he
founded his description on specimens collected by Mr. E. E. Galpin,
F.L.S., in 1887, on the Saddleback Mountains, Barberton.</p>

<p><i>Dimorphotheca spectabilis</i> is a spring flowering plant, and is common
around Pretoria during the months of September and October. It is a
well-grown plant with large mauve flowers, and if introduced into
cultivation would be an acquisition to any garden. The plant sets seed
freely, and could easily be raised by this means. The species is
poisonous, and in experiments carried out by the Division of Veterinary
Research, the plant was found to cause death in sheep fed on it.</p>

<p>The genus <i>Mimetes</i> constitutes a small group of South African
Proteaceae of nine species, all confined to the South-Western area of
the Cape Province. The genus was first founded by Salisbury, but for
over one hundred years afterwards plants belonging to two other distinct
genera were placed under the name <i>Mimetes</i>. One of these, <i>Orothamnus
Zeyheri</i>, we figured on Plate 38 of this work. Like a great many other
groups of South African plants the species of <i>Mimetes</i> have not been
extensively collected, and we are indebted to Mr. T. P. Stokoe, of Cape
Town, who has rediscovered so many interesting plants on the Hottentot
Hollands Mountains, for the opportunity of figuring the present species.
The examination of the fresh material has enabled us to add a few
descriptive details to the description given in the <i>Flora Capensis</i>.</p>

<hr />

<p>This species is a common tree in the eastern parts of the Cape Province
and also in the coastal and midland districts of Natal. The plant is
known as the “Kaffir Boom,” and to children in Natal as “Cookie
Doodles.” The Zulu name for the tree is “Umsini.”</p>

<p>The wood is very soft, and the only use to which it is put is for
fencing poles, as it easily takes root and is free from the attack of
termites. The scarlet seeds are strung as necklaces.</p>

<p>In various parts of the country the tree may be seen in cultivation, and
when in full bloom the bright scarlet flowers make it extremely
ornamental. The tree is deciduous and the flowers appear in spring while
the plant is still leafless, but occasionally leaves and flowers may be
produced at the same time.</p>

<p>Our plate was prepared from material collected by Miss K. A. Lansdell on
the Berea, Durban, Natal. Specimens are preserved in the National
Herbarium, Pretoria (Herb. No. 1456).</p>

<p>The plant here figured was introduced into Kew Gardens in the year 1758.
Though it has been more than once illustrated in botanical publications,
we do not apologise for reproducing this coloured illustration of one of
the common bulbs found in so many gardens at the Cape. The species
<i>grandiflora</i> is represented by many colour varieties, and is probably
the same as the plant described as <i>Spiraxis tricolor</i>, which only
appears to differ from it in the colour markings on the perianth. The
variety here figured is probably the form originally described under the
name <i>Spiraxis atropurpurea</i>.</p>

<p>The specimens were collected by Dr. R. Marloth, who forwarded them to

botanical science for a considerable time, and was first described under
its present name over 100 years ago.</p>

<p>During the month of September the veld round Pretoria is carpeted with
the white flowers of this little <i>Gazania</i>. It is one of the first, if
not the first plant to flower on burnt veld, and the contrast in colour
between the white flowers and the young green grass is very striking.
While so extremely common during the spring months, this species appears
to be little known botanically. It was evidently first collected by the
botanist Karl Zeyher on the Magaliesberg about the year 1841, and the
description in the <i>Flora Capensis</i> based on Zeyher’s specimen is the
most recent published information we have about this species. The plants
are tufted, several underground stems arising from a stout tap-root.</p>

<p>The present plate was prepared from specimens collected by Mr. D. Fouche
on the outskirts of Pretoria. Specimens are preserved in the National
Herbarium, Pretoria.</p>

<p><i>Ornithogalum Thunbergianum</i>, the “Yellow Chinkerichee,” is found in the
Malmesbury, Paarl, and Van Rhynsdorp Districts of Cape Province. It was
found by Carl Thunberg at Saldana Bay about the year 1772, and named by
him <i>O. maculatum</i>, but as this specific name had already been given to
a plant figured by Jacquin, the late Mr. Baker redescribed the species
here dealt with and named it after Thunberg, although there is some
doubt as to whether the plant figured by Jacquin is specifically
distinct from <i>O. Thunbergianum</i>.</p>

<p>The perianth is a beautiful “flame scarlet” colour with a black mark at
the tip of the three outer segments. The species should be grown by all
lovers of our native flora, and would well repay cultivation.</p>

<p>Our species was first figured in Curtis’ <i>Botanical Magazine</i> in 1804
from a plant which was raised in Salisbury’s garden at Brompton,
England. It is not at all a well-known plant, as it is only recorded in
the <i>Flora Capensis</i> as having been collected by Zeyher in the
Clanwilliam District, and by Ecklon at Groenkloof in the Malmesbury
District. The plant from which our plate was prepared was sent to the
Division of Botany, Pretoria, by Mrs. E. Rood from Van Rhynsdorp. The
genus <i>Ferraria</i> is represented in South Africa by six species, and by
one species in Angola. The flowers last only for a very short time after
opening, but a succession of flowers appears on each plant. None of the
species can be called ornamental from a gardener’s point of view, but
the structure of the flower is very beautiful and the colouring quaint.
Plants would only be grown as a botanical curiosity, and not for their
beauty. Specimens are preserved in the National Herbarium, Pretoria

<p>The Genus <i>Harveya</i> contains 27 species, all of which are parasitic on
the roots of other plants. In South Africa 21 species are recorded, the
remainder being found in Tropical Africa and the Mascarene Islands. The
name was given by Sir William Hooker in commemoration of Dr. Harvey, who
was one of the pioneers of South African systematic botany. The plant
belongs to a group known as total parasites, <i>i.e.</i> it is wholly
dependent on its host for its food supply. Specialised roots technically
known as “haustoria” penetrate the roots of the host plant and absorb
the requisite food material.</p>

<p>The species here figured occurs in the Cape Peninsula, all along the
western coastal districts to Clanwilliam and Van Rhynsdorp and into
Little Namaqualand. It has also been recorded from the sand-dunes near
Durban in Natal. The specimens from which our plate was prepared were
collected by Mrs. E. Rood at Van Rhynsdorp, and are preserved in the

<p>This extremely handsome species of <i>Gazania</i> was cultivated by Mr. C. N.
Knox-Davies in Johannesburg from plants collected at Worcester in the
Cape Province. The plants form a dense mass, and are suitable either for
growing in a border or in large pots. The ray florets are a beautiful
nopal red, with a warm sepia-brown eye-spot at the base, and when the
plants are in full bloom they present a very striking appearance. It is
surprising that species of this genus, which are amongst the most
handsome of the South African Compositae, have received so little
attention from horticulturists, and though hundreds of our native plants
have been figured in the <i>Botanical Magazine</i> only two species of
Gazania have been illustrated.</p>

<p>Mr. N. E. Brown, who contributed an account of the genus to <i>The
Garden</i>, wrote that “it is one of the most perplexing that a botanist
has to deal with,” and even to-day the species are very imperfectly
known. Our plant was submitted to Kew for verification of the name, and
the Director reports, “The <i>Gazania</i> has not been exactly matched, but
might be regarded as a form of <i>G. Pavonia, R. Br.</i>”</p>

<p>This <i>Ochna</i>, which is found in the Transvaal around Pretoria and at
Messina, has hitherto been confused with <i>O. atropurpurea</i>, but is
easily distinguished from that species by the larger more expanded
flowers and the non-pustulate branches. The latter character
distinguishes <i>O. atropurpurea</i> from all the other South African species
of the genus.</p>

<p>Our plate was prepared from specimens collected on Meintjes Kop,
Pretoria, by Mr. D. J. Fouche in September, 1921. It is a low spreading
bush, and at this time of the year is one mass of sweet-smelling yellow
flowers. The leaves do not appear until December or January, and it is
then that the green sepals enlarge and turn a blood-red colour and
surround the black fruit. The plant, therefore, either in flower or
fruit makes a very ornamental shrub and well worth the attention of
cultivators.</p>

<p>The genus <i>Ochna</i> contains several species producing valuable timber.</p>

<hr />

<p>This rare and interesting plant was found by Dr. R. Marloth in the
Calvinia District. An examination of fresh specimens has enabled us to
reduce the three species described in the “Flora Capensis” to a single
species, and the genus <i>Daubenya</i> therefore becomes one of South
Africa’s monotypic genera. Our conclusions have been confirmed by
independent observations made by Dr. Marloth, and we give below the
notes he forwarded to the Division of Botany.</p>

<p>“The colour of the flower is the most brilliant scarlet known in the
Flora of South Africa, and especially dazzling when seen in full
sunlight. This effect is due to the combination of two pigments in the
subepidermal tissues of the flower, viz. a granular yellow pigment
distributed through all the cells, and a bright red solution present in
most of the cells of the subepidermal layer, but absent in others. This
peculiarity of structure also explains the occurrence of plants with
yellow flowers, for if through some cause or other (as a sport), the red
pigment is not produced, the flower is plain yellow, just as in such a
case the flower of the red <i>Watsonia</i> (<i>W. rosa</i>) becomes pure white
(Arderne’s Watsonia). It so happened that the yellow form was first
introduced into England and described by Lindley as <i>Daubenya aurea</i>
(1835), hence this name has to be retained for the species, although the
flower is generally scarlet, and the yellow form has only arisen as a
sport. There is, however, no structural difference between <i>D. aurea</i>
Lindl., <i>D. coccinea</i> Harv., and <i>D. fulva</i> Lindl.”</p>

<p>The length of the floral segments and of the peduncle, given as
distinguishing characters by Lindley, is very variable in the specimens
seen by us (over one hundred); some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_130" id="page_130">{130}</a></span> them are scarlet, others yellow,
and some dull orange. The scent of the flowers is unpleasant, somewhat
recalling that of the flowers of <i>Rhus</i>.</p>

<p>The home of this remarkable plant was unknown to botanists until
re-discovered in 1920. It grows in heavy red clay soil on the farm
Fransplaas, about 40 miles north of Sutherland, and flowers in
September.</p>

<p>The genus was named by Dr. Lindley in honour of Dr. Charles Daubeny,
Professor of Botany at Oxford, “whose interesting researches in
vegetable Chemistry have materially conduced to improve our knowledge of
the physiology of plants.”</p>

<p>This interesting <i>Stapelia</i> was first discovered by Mr. N. S. Pillans,
of Cape Town, at Witte Poort in the Laingsburg Division, and described
by Mr. N. E. Brown, to whom Mr. Pillans sent most of his collections of
this group. Our plant is one of the larger-flowered species of the
genus, resembling in this respect <i>S. gigantea</i> and <i>S. nobilis</i>, but
differing in colour from both these species. The flowers have a distinct
carrion-like odour, although this is not so strong as in many other
species of the genus. When in bud the petals form an acuminate beak
recurved at the apex. Under cultivation in the greenhouse the stems turn
a dark reddish-brown colour.</p>

<p>Our specimen was collected by Dr. I. B. Pole Evans at Laingsburg, and
flowered at the Division of Botany, Pretoria, in October, 1921.

<p>This interesting <i>Leucospermum</i> was collected by Mr. T. P. Stokoe in Jan
du Toit’s Kloof near Chavonnesberg, in the Western Province. Mr. Stokoe
states that only a few plants were observed growing in a belt of
<i>Proteaceae</i>. It is evidently very closely related to <i>L. tottum</i>, from
which it differs in having glabrous branches and non-ciliate involucral
bracts, and should be regarded as a glabrous variety of this species.
The genus <i>Leucospermum</i> is closely related to <i>Protea</i> (see plate 22)
but differs from that genus in having the limb of the posticous segment
divided and not completely fused. The well-known “Kreupelboom” (<i>L.
concospermum</i>) belongs to this genus.</p>

<p>The variety here figured might be regarded as one of the more striking

<p>This handsome <i>Ornithogalum</i> was collected by Mr. E. Rood at Van
Rhynsdorp, and forwarded to the Division of Botany, Pretoria. The
perianth segments are a deep reddish-brown, edged with white, and the
flowers are extremely fragrant. Specimens were sent to Kew, and the
Director reports that the plant had not been matched, the nearest
affinity being <i>O. suaveolens</i>, Jacq., and that it was evidently a new
species. This species exhibits a device for cross-pollination by the
movement of the style. As soon as the flower opens the style bends
downwards, and is thus in a position to receive pollen from the abdomen
of a visiting insect. As the flowers wither the perianth segments close
up, and the style becomes erect and would then be self-pollinated if
cross-pollination has not taken place.</p>

<p>This plant is of interest as being one of the many outliers of the
Tropical African flora in Southern Africa, and also as showing a
connection between the floras of Eastern India and Tropical Africa. The
genus <i>Crossandra</i> is represented by about 15 species, most of which
occur in Tropical Africa, and one is recorded from India and the Malay
States. The species figured here occurs in the Nyasa Highlands, and
extends into Natal and the Transvaal as far south as Pretoria. During
the month of October the plant may be found in flower in the
neighbourhood of the Premier Mine, Pretoria, and the bright scarlet
flowers form a conspicuous feature in the veld. Specimens have been
recorded from various localities in the Northern Transvaal.</p>

<p>The fruits, as is so frequent in many species of <i>Acanthaceae</i>, have an
explosive mechanism, <i>i.e.</i> they burst suddenly into two valves when
wetted and scatter the seeds. The seeds, of which there are four in each
fruit, are tightly enveloped with long hairs which straighten out and
become mucilaginous when wet, thus fixing the seed to the ground.</p>

<hr />

<p>This interesting plant is so like some species of <i>Mesembryanthemum</i> in
general appearance, that most would unhesitatingly place it in that
genus. For a long time past, however, as I have elsewhere stated, it has
been dawning upon me that <i>Mesembryanthemum</i>, as at present understood,
is rather of the nature of a natural order than of a single genus. In
vegetative characters it presents a very great amount of variation, and
in most cases any particular kind of variation is found to be common to
several species, so as to form of them a group, indicating a generic
difference from the others. About a hundred years ago Haworth recognised
this and gave generic names to some of the groups he had formed, which
have neither been accepted nor taken notice of by subsequent authors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_158" id="page_158">{158}</a></span></p>

<p>Undoubtedly there is a great similarity in the flowers of many groups of
this genus that differ widely in their vegetative characteristics; yet
when investigated differences in floral structure may often be found
also, which, taken in conjunction with vegetative characters, are quite
as great and as distinctive as those which separate genera in many other
families of plants. This is the case with the plant at present under
consideration, for I find that it has a combination of three floral
characters, which, so far as known to me do not all occur together in
any species of <i>Mesembryanthemum</i>, namely: (1) the calyx is produced
into a distinct green tube above the ovary; (2) the stamens are all
abruptly bent down into the calyx-tube; and (3) the stigma is sessile,
undivided, and inconspicuous. Upon this combination of characters in
conjunction with its vegetative character, I establish a new genus, and
have much pleasure in naming it after its discoverer, Mrs. E. Rood, of
Van Rhynsdorp, who sent living plants of it to Dr. I. B. Pole Evans at
Pretoria, where it flowered. The accompanying figure of it was sent to
me by Dr. Pole Evans, together with a living plant and a flower in
fluid, with some notes by Dr. E. P. Phillips, from which the description
has been prepared.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Description</span>:&mdash;A dwarf succulent plant branching at or below ground level
and forming clumps about 8-11 cm. high. <i>Leaves</i> 2 to each growth, or 4
when the new growth is made, 8-11 cm. long, 10-15 mm. thick, erect,
nearly cylindric or finger-like, but with the inner face flattened,
united at the base, obtuse at the apex, glabrous and smooth, green
below, purplish at the apical part. <i>Peduncle</i> erect, 3-6 cm. long, and
4-5 mm. thick at the apex, with a pair of bracts about 2 cm. long below
the middle. <i>Calyx</i> 6-lobed, tube (including the ovary) 10 mm. long,
produced about 7 mm. above the ovary, about 10-11 mm. in diameter,
slightly constricted under the lobes, glabrous, green; lobes unequal,
5-8 mm. long, 5-7 mm. broad, ovate, subacute or obtuse, four of them
with membranous margins. <i>Corolla</i> about 4 cm. in diameter, petals
numerous, in about 4 series, loosely recurved, spreading over one
another, the outer about 15 mm. long and 1 mm. broad, the others
gradually shorter, all linear, obtuse or notched at the apex, bright
magenta. <i>Stamens</i> very numerous, all abruptly bent into and closely
pressed against the calyx-tube in a dense mass, leaving a clear central
opening to the stigma,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_159" id="page_159">{159}</a></span> the outermost series being the shortest.

<p>It may not be out of place to point out that dried specimens of
<i>Mesembryanthemum chrysoleucum</i>, Schlechter are so similar to <i>Roodia
digitifolia</i> in general appearance, that the plant might easily be
mistaken for a species of <i>Roodia</i>. It differs, however, by being
destitute of bracts on its peduncle; by the leaves, peduncle, and calyx
being papillate; by the calyx being lobed down to the top of the ovary,
the stamens erect; and by having 7 stigmas and a 7-celled capsule.&mdash;<span class="smcap">N.

a low half-climbing bush, and when in flower is a striking object in the
veld, the bright red flowers standing out in sharp contrast to the
surrounding vegetation. Specimens were first sent to Kew in 1880 by Mr.
T. Nelson, and later Mr. E. E. Galpin sent material which he collected
at Barberton. The plant lends itself to cultivation, and may be kept as
a trimmed bush in lawns, etc. If left to grow unchecked it becomes very
lanky. Our plate was prepared from a specimen growing in the garden of
the Division of Botany, Pretoria, and the plant has grown to a height of
about 30 ft. up a tree of <i>Cupressus sempervirens</i>, var. <i>pyramidalis</i>.
In cultivation, at least in Pretoria, very few seeds are produced.

41. Our present species differs from <i>K. partita</i> in the more spreading
leaves, the very much shorter perianth-tube, the narrower segments which
have a red limb, and the larger capsule. The genus <i>Klattia</i> is closely
related to <i>Witsenia</i>, which we figured on plate 34, but is
distinguished from this genus by having a very short perianth-tube and
long segments, much longer than the tube. <i>Klattia</i> was named in honour
of Dr. F. W. Klatt, a teacher at Hamburg, who published several memoirs
on the <i>Iridaceae</i>.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
